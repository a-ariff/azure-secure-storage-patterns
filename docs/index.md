# Azure Secure Storage Patterns

Comprehensive documentation for implementing secure data storage solutions in Microsoft Azure.

## Overview

This documentation site provides best practices, implementation patterns, and security guidelines for Azure storage services. Our focus areas include encryption, access controls, compliance frameworks, and security baseline configurations.

## Core Security Areas

### üîê Encryption

- **Data at Rest**: Azure Storage Service Encryption (SSE) with customer-managed keys
- **Data in Transit**: TLS 1.3 enforcement and secure transport protocols
- **Application-Level**: Client-side encryption patterns and key management
- **Database Encryption**: Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) and Always Encrypted features

### üõ°Ô∏è Access Control

- **Identity & Access Management**: Azure AD integration and role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Network Security**: Private endpoints, service endpoints, and firewall rules
- **Shared Access Signatures**: Secure delegation patterns and time-bound access
- **Storage Account Security**: Access key rotation and managed identity usage

### üìã Compliance

- **Regulatory Standards**: SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR, HIPAA compliance patterns
- **Data Residency**: Geographic data placement and sovereignty requirements
- **Audit & Monitoring**: Azure Monitor, Storage Analytics, and compliance reporting
- **Data Lifecycle**: Retention policies, archival strategies, and secure deletion

## Documentation Structure

- **[Security Baseline](./security-baseline.md)** - Foundational security configurations and controls
