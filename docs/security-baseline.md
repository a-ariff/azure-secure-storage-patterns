# Security Baseline for Azure Secure Storage

This document outlines the foundational security configurations and controls required for implementing secure storage patterns in Microsoft Azure.

## Baseline Security Controls

### 1. Identity and Access Management

#### Required Configurations
- **Azure AD Integration**: All storage accounts must be integrated with Azure Active Directory
- **RBAC Assignment**: Implement principle of least privilege using built-in and custom roles
- **Conditional Access**: Enable multi-factor authentication for privileged access
- **PIM (Privileged Identity Management)**: Use JIT access for administrative operations

#### Control Validation
```powershell
# Verify RBAC assignments
Get-AzRoleAssignment -Scope "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{rg-name}"

# Check conditional access policies
Get-AzureADMSConditionalAccessPolicy | Where-Object {$_.State -eq "Enabled"}
```

### 2. Network Security

#### Required Configurations
- **Private Endpoints**: Deploy for all storage accounts in production
- **Service Endpoints**: Configure for VNet-integrated resources
- **Firewall Rules**: Implement IP allow-listing for management access
- **DNS Configuration**: Use private DNS zones for endpoint resolution

#### Network Topology
```
[Application Subnet] -> [Private Endpoint] -> [Storage Account]
                            |
                     [Private DNS Zone]
```

### 3. Data Protection

#### Encryption at Rest
- **Storage Service Encryption (SSE)**: Enabled by default with Microsoft-managed keys
- **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK)**: Required for sensitive workloads
- **Key Vault Integration**: Store and manage encryption keys securely
- **Key Rotation**: Automated rotation every 90 days minimum

#### Encryption in Transit
- **HTTPS Only**: Enforce secure transfer for all client connections
- **TLS Version**: Minimum TLS 1.2, prefer TLS 1.3
- **Certificate Validation**: Verify SSL/TLS certificates in client applications

### 4. Monitoring and Auditing

#### Required Logging
- **Storage Analytics**: Enable for all storage services
- **Azure Monitor**: Configure metrics and alerts
- **Activity Logs**: Capture all management plane operations
- **Diagnostic Logs**: Enable for data plane operations

#### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Unauthorized access attempts
- Data egress patterns
- Authentication failures
- Encryption key access events
- Network traffic anomalies

### 5. Data Lifecycle Management

#### Access Tier Policies
- **Hot Tier**: Frequently accessed data (< 30 days)
- **Cool Tier**: Infrequently accessed data (30-90 days)
- **Archive Tier**: Long-term retention data (> 90 days)

#### Retention and Deletion
- **Legal Hold**: Implement for compliance requirements
- **Immutable Storage**: Use for WORM (Write Once, Read Many) scenarios
- **Secure Deletion**: Verify cryptographic erasure capabilities

## Compliance Mappings

### SOC 2 Type II

## Implementation Checklist

### Pre-Deployment
- [ ] Define data classification and sensitivity levels
- [ ] Establish network security architecture
- [ ] Configure Azure Key Vault for key management
- [ ] Set up monitoring and alerting infrastructure

### Deployment
- [ ] Create storage accounts with security baselines
- [ ] Configure private endpoints and DNS
- [ ] Implement RBAC and conditional access policies
- [ ] Enable encryption with customer-managed keys
- [ ] Configure lifecycle management policies

### Post-Deployment
- [ ] Validate security controls through testing
- [ ] Configure monitoring dashboards
- [ ] Establish incident response procedures
- [ ] Document security configurations
- [ ] Schedule regular security reviews

## Security Testing

### Penetration Testing
- Network segmentation validation
- Access control bypass attempts
- Encryption strength verification
- Data exfiltration scenarios

### Vulnerability Assessments
- Microsoft Defender for Cloud integration
- Regular security configuration reviews
- Automated compliance scanning
- Third-party security assessments

## Incident Response

### Detection
- Real-time alerting on security events
- Automated threat detection with Sentinel
- Anomaly detection for access patterns
- Integration with SIEM systems

### Response Procedures
1. **Immediate**: Isolate affected resources
2. **Assessment**: Determine scope and impact
3. **Containment**: Prevent further compromise
4. **Recovery**: Restore services securely
5. **Lessons Learned**: Update security controls

## Maintenance

### Regular Reviews
- **Monthly**: Access review and cleanup
- **Quarterly**: Security configuration assessment
- **Semi-Annual**: Compliance audit preparation
- **Annual**: Complete security architecture review

### Updates and Patches
- Azure service updates (automatic)
- Security policy updates (quarterly)
- Key rotation schedules (90 days)
- Documentation updates (continuous)
